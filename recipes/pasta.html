            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>½ pound sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups whipping cream</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chpped pasley</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted 
                water to a boil. Add tortellini. Cook, 
                stirring occasionally, until tortellini 
                float to the top and the filling is hot, 
                about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet 
                over medium heat; cook and stir chicken 
                breast in hot oil until no longer pink in 
                the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from 
                heat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in another skillet over 
                medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms 
                and garlic powder until mushrooms 
                begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir 
                heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to 
                a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and 
                simmer until slightly thickened, about 
                3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, 
                and salt. Continue to cook until cheese 
                is melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir tortellini and chicken into 
                mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer until heated 
                through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
